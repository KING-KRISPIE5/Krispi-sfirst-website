<h3>This is tiring</h3>
<p>How do people have the energy for this? This has to make you a lot of money if this is what you have to do. And Ai does this in minutes or will be able to soon. At least it isn't BrainF***, Urban Muller was a madman. Idk if this will be the same as coding on my phone. I hope this works.
</p>
<p>I might have just wasted my time but none of this was serious so it is okay.</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone else will somehow find this site.</p>
